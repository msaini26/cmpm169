        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            We chose to imitate a text based design art:
            <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_1_3_01">example</a>. 
            The initial setup was fairly straightforward because the author of the original piece 
            commented on a significant portion of their code. As a result, we were able to quickly
            understand the functionality and integration of the code to create the text-based art piece.
            At first, we were confused about how the opacity for each letter was created, but we quickly
            realized that the frequency of the letter determined the opacity percentage. In the image above,
            this was a point in which we were stuck while imitating the original art piece. The letters at
            this point were stagnant, but we could not figure out why since the mouse should have affected
            the orientation and position of the letters. After some time, we figured out that we never set
            an x and y-position for where the letters should move relative to the mouse. We also never set
            anything related to the mouse, so we realized there would be no interaction until we included a
            ‘mouse pressed’ function or a similar option. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            For integration, we first started by replacing the original text with a poem about nature and the 
            beauty of outdoor landscapes. We also wanted to integrate the following into our original art piece: 
            <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_0_01">example</a>. First, we 
            integrated the dynamic scale-changing abilities into the original poem landscape, which we represented 
            by a change in text scale with the ‘mouseDragged’ and ‘mouseMoved’ functions. We ran into a couple issues 
            where the scale only affected a certain number of the letters, but we realized that our code structure
            was too specific to groups of letters. As a result, we generalized our code to fit a larger collection 
            of letters, which you can see in the result above. We also wanted to integrate the interactive elements 
            from the integration sample we linked earlier. Therefore, we included an option for users to add more 
            letters to the poem if they wanted to. The newly generated letters also follow the same interaction patterns 
            as the original output: the scale changes and boldness of the letters themselves. We also created a new 
            design for the letters where they are cleared and redrawn depending on the user’s mouse interaction with 
            the art piece.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            After implementing the poem, we thought it would be really cool to contrast the idea of nature and being 
            outdoors with what our society has become today. We wanted to incorporate the aspect of how everyone is 
            constantly on their phones these days and represent this through text messages. We found this really cool 
            example that perfectly emulates what we envisioned: <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2182708">example</a>. 
            We first changed all the written text into nature-based emojis to illustrate how instead of going outdoors to 
            see nature, people would rather just spend time on their phones and look at images/other tech-related visualizations.
            We then had some issues simulating the text effect that the example had because we weren't able to constantly
            draw the messages on top of each other. This was due to the fact that the poem transitions/movement relies on 
            the background being constantly redrawn. After a few tries, we figured out that we could utilize push and pop 
            to change the frameRate for just the text message and display it on the screen for a few seconds so it is more 
            readable and doesn't flash in a few seconds. We also decided to keep it as one message being displayed at a time
            to get a better representation of how a chat between two people usually goes.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Mansi - I worked on the imitation stage, creating the dynamic text animation that changes based on the frequency 
            of the letters. The higher the frequency of a letter, the higher the visibility with minimal transparency; the 
            opposite is the case for less frequent letters. For the integration stage, I integrated the example with the 
            letter scaling effects and dynamic changes. Instead of a single letter creating the dynamics, I integrated the 
            mechanics into the current poem to include more interactive elements with the user’s input.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rebecca - I mainly worked on innovate and this reflection. I combined the text messages with our poem and played around 
            with how we wanted the messages to be presented/drawn. I messed around with what we wanted to display in the texts, 
            keeping it as emojis or using text. We liked the contrast of words with images so we decided to go with emojis. I 
            also randomized the different colored text, making it seem like a conversation between two people. I also messed a 
            bit with figuring out how to draw the messages so that they were readable and would be drawn for longer than a 
            millisecond.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are proud of the final result of our projects and loved to see how the result progressed from the initial stages. 
            Originally, we didn’t think much about where we wanted this text art to go. We first just added a poem that we 
            both liked and wanted to see where it could take us. In the beginning, we mainly focused on messing around with 
            just the poem and didn’t really consider what else we could add on top of it to send some kind of message. We 
            really liked playing around with the size of each character and how they shift/move. After messing around with 
            the poem, we then started to brainstorm some other ideas to make the poem even more interesting. We then remembered 
            that there was an example during section of using emojis as text. We really liked this concept and decided to create 
            something similar to this. We found an example that really matched the concept we were going for and that’s how we 
            came up with text messages. This led to the idea of making a contrast between the nature based poem and a conversation 
            through text messages. We really enjoyed how we were able to slowly branch off of ideas to create something deep and 
            meaningful. We started off with just a poem and it turned into something much more unique and interesting. We worked 
            well together as a team, leaning on each other for support when needed. Especially with pair programming, communication 
            is absolutely essential, and we made sure to give each other regular updates on how our parts of the project were progressing. 
          </p>

            One high of this project was how seamless and clean our text output was during the integration stage. Sometimes with varying 
            generative examples, the integration stage provides a messy output with complex bugs. We were lucky that we created a clean 
            code structure from the beginning with spaces to integrate the second example. Another high was how we were able to create 
            something that is unique and special. We really liked how the poem and text messages turned out and in a way, compliment each 
            other really well. One low would be the errors we ran into during innovate. We bumped into the issue of needing to redraw the 
            background for one example but not the other. Because of this, we had to reevaluate how we wanted to draw each element 
            but in the end, we figured it out and it turned out really nice.

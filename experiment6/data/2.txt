In twilight's glow, the stars awake,
A silent symphony they gently make.
Whispers of night, in the moon's soft light,
Painting dreams with hues of delight.

In fields of gold, where wildflowers sway,
The melody of life begins to play.
Beneath the sky, where dreams take flight,
Embracing the magic of the night.

So let us dance in this moonlit trance,
Where time slows down in a graceful dance.
For in the stillness of the night's sweet song,
We find the peace for which we long.

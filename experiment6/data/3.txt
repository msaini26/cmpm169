Upon the shore, where the ocean meets the land,
Footprints in the sand, left by a wanderer's hand.
Seashells whisper secrets, carried by the tide,
As waves caress the shore with a gentle glide.

Sunset hues paint the sky in shades of gold,
A masterpiece of colors, a sight to behold.
Seabirds soar on the breeze, their freedom wide,
In this tranquil moment, worries subside.

As night descends and stars begin to gleam,
The ocean's lullaby becomes a dream.
In the embrace of nature's soothing rhyme,
We find solace in the passage of time.

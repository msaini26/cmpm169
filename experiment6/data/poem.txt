In the world's embrace, nature's grand display,
Mountains tall, where eagles soar and play.
Forests deep, where whispers of the trees,
Sing songs of life carried on the breeze.

Rivers winding, carving paths of their own,
Reflecting the sky in a liquid tone.
Deserts vast, with sands that shimmer and dance,
Underneath the sun's fiery glance.

Oceans vast, with waves that rise and fall,
A symphony of blue, embracing all.
In every leaf, in every creature's eye,
Nature's beauty and wonder lie.

So let us cherish this world so grand,
And protect its treasures, hand in hand.
For in the world's nature, we find our home,
A sanctuary where dreams and realities roam.

In a meadow green, where wildflowers bloom,
Nature's tapestry unfurls in full bloom.
Butterflies dance on a gentle breeze,
Whispering secrets among the trees.

Sunlight filters through the canopy above,
A symphony of life, a chorus of love.
Birds serenade with their melodious song,
In this tranquil haven where we belong.

          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            We chose to imitate a 3-D flower design: <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1162440"></a>. At first, setting up the lighting and the shaders was quite
            complicated to figure out. The point lighting would at first grey
            out the flower structure, and in other situations, the flower would
            be completely dark. After reading through the documentation to
            better understand the functionality of point light, we realized that
            we didn’t specify the lighting along the z-axis, which was causing
            our original bugs. We are excited to experiment with the current
            output and see how the flower will evolve into something completely
            different.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build
            upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources.
            This might involve combining elements from different programming
            languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing
            together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By
            integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can
            create something new and unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to
            make something new? Document this step.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            After implementing the flower, we decided to add in a fun and unique background. We 
            found this example: <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1613367"></a> and wanted 
            to try and add this to our piece. We had some issues combining the background with the 
            flower but we eventually figured it out. Because of the way our sketch is implemented, 
            we had to discard some elements and rethink how we wanted it to look like. Instead of making 
            the background fill up the entire screen with lines, we ended up just having the lines randomly 
            draw onto the screen and rotate around. This way, it didn't mess up the overall feel of the flower 
            and also made the lines look like they were sprouting from the flower.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Mansi - I worked on the imitate and integrate portion of the project, trying new 
            techniques and experimenting with the original flower design. I experimented with 
            WEBGL’s offerings to include new shapes and lighting to create more interaction for 
            the user itself. The user is able to zoom in and out of the design, press any key to 
            save an image of the art piece, display more particle emmission by releasing their 
            mouse, and move their mouse around the piece to rotate the art piece. I also experimented 
            with point lighting, trying out different color schemes, angles of light, and volumes of 
            light on a specific region. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Rebecca - I worked mainly on innovate and the reflection portions. I experimented 
            around with combining 2D elements with 3D objects. It was also quite interesting to 
            see what we can do in WEBGL. There were a few issues figuring out how to combine the 
            background nicely with the flower but I eventually figured it out. Originally, we had 
            some other background ideas in mind but they didn’t work well with the WEBGL library. 
            Overall, it was quite interesting experimenting with drawing randomized lines and utilizing 
            random angles through sine/cosine to make the lines rotate around.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are very happy with the final result and are quite surprised at how our design evolved 
            from a regular flower to one that has sprouting elements coming from the flower. We really 
            enjoyed playing around with 3D objects as well as messing around with the lighting. Changing 
            up the textures and how the overall vibe/look feels was very fun and we feel like we learned 
            a lot from it. We were truly able to make the examples into our own piece. Adding in the 
            background element was also fascinating in that it added a lot to the flower. Originally, the 
            flower felt a bit simplistic so we wanted to add something more to the background. This background 
            eventually turned into something that felt more like a part of the flower than just a background 
            itself. We really loved how the lines looked like they were sprouting from the flower. Even though 
            we ran into some issues of not being able to implement the same look as the example, it actually 
            helped our piece into creating something more different and unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            One high of the project was that we were able to combine 3D and 2D elements together to create something 
            unique and aesthetically pleasing. We were able to quickly pick up on how 3D objects work and were very 
            happy about how the piece turned out. One low of the project would have to be the issues that popped up 
            when combining elements together. We had a few different backgrounds in mind but because of how we implemented 
            the flower, we couldn’t use those examples. A lot of them did not work well with WEBGL so we had to explore 
            deeper and find something that fits well. Even though we weren’t able to use some backgrounds, it ended up 
            helping us to create something that is truly unique and fits well. From this, we learned that sometimes 
            restrictions/limitations end up helping us create something new and different. It helped guide us into using 
            techniques that we hadn’t considered before which really helped make our piece more successful.

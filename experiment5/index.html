          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            We chose to imitate a 3-D flower design: <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1162440"></a>. At first, setting up the lighting and the shaders was quite
            complicated to figure out. The point lighting would at first grey
            out the flower structure, and in other situations, the flower would
            be completely dark. After reading through the documentation to
            better understand the functionality of point light, we realized that
            we didn’t specify the lighting along the z-axis, which was causing
            our original bugs. We are excited to experiment with the current
            output and see how the flower will evolve into something completely
            different.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build
            upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources.
            This might involve combining elements from different programming
            languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing
            together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By
            integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can
            create something new and unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to
            make something new? Document this step.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding
            process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This
            might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or
            using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating
            and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly
            groundbreaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something
            truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process,
            the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where
            you can put your reflections.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
            <li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
            <li>Brief highs and lows</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start
            by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve
            reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques,
            or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it
            works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and
            strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done
            before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for
            improvement and innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code
            itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.

          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build
            upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources.
            This might involve combining elements from different programming
            languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing
            together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By
            integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can
            create something new and unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to
            make something new? Document this step.

          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding
            process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This
            might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or
            using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating
            and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly
            groundbreaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something
            truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process,
            the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where
            you can put your reflections.

              <strong>
                I worked on the project from start to finish. I experimented
                with the 3-d libraries and generative vectors/animation. I
                created three variations on the animations to allow the user to
                interact with the art piece itself. I included a depth
                perspective on the 3rd and 1st variation of the art piece to
                make the user feel like the lines and shapes are closer and
                further away.</strong

            <p>
              <strong
                >I am happy with the final result of this project, and I liked
                the idea of experimenting with different libraries to see what I
                liked as the final result. I am glad that I split up this
                experiment over the week because I wanted to focus on a new
                style/option in my design each day.

            <li>Brief highs and lows</li>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Some highs from this project are that I successfully figured
                out how to create varying interactions based on the user's
                input, change the backgrounds as the user interacts with the
                pieces, and created a depth perspective where some shapes are
                closer and further away from each other on the screen
                (illusion). Some lows from this project are that I was
                struggling with creating changing colors randomly without
                messing with the 2-d interactions. I also had trouble modifying
                the 3-d depth perspective without messing with the 2-d
                animation. It took a while to debug, but I am happy with the
                final result.

            the vectors are. <strong>D or d</strong> will change the thickness
            of the vectors

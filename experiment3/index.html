          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            Mansi - I chose to imitate the following simulation:
            https://openprocessing.org/sketch/494102 I enjoyed walking through
            the steps of recreating this simulation to better understand how
            noise works in comparison to randomness. In the recreation process,
            I accidentally switched the naming conventions for the particle’s
            movement with its respective x and y coordinates. As a result, the
            particles were solely following the initial set coordinates versus
            moving to their updated position to create the flowing noise effect.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rebecca - As our first time pair programming for this class, we
            decided to each choose an example to imitate. The one I chose is the
            following: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1247971 While
            implementing the example, I ran into some issues with functions
            being undefined. To fix this, I realized I had to import one of the
            libraries they use to randomly generate color palettes as
            illustrated in the below two images. This library helps get arrays
            of random colors that fit within a certain color scheme which makes
            the piece look more cohesive and professional. I found where to
            implement the library through
            https://editor.p5js.org/yellow/sketches/enFPR1YKz.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build
            upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources.
            This might involve combining elements from different programming
            languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing
            together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By
            integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can
            create something new and unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we were able to implement both examples, we ran into some
            issues on how to combine the two techniques together. We realized
            that we had to edit how one of the sketches was formatted and turn
            it into a class instead. This way, we could create an object of the
            class in the other sketch to draw them on top of each other. Once we
            reorganized Mansi’s example to follow a class layout, we then ran
            into another issue. Mansi’s example showed up on top of Rebecca’s
            design but it doesn’t continuously draw and only shows up as small
            random dots all over the screen. We then found out that it was
            because there was a specification of noLoop() inside of the setup of
            Rebecca’s design, as illustrated in the image below. The example
            uses this so the generated artwork doesn’t continuously flash a
            different design and instead, keeps one until you refresh the entire
            browser. Because of the noLoop(), we had to come up with another
            method to continuously loop Mansi’s design but only generate
            Rebecca’s design once. After playing around with the code, we
            figured out that the easiest solution would be to create a boolean
            around the display method for Rebecca’s design so it would only draw
            once. This way, Mansi’s design could continuously draw while
            Rebecca’s design stays static. After integrating both techniques,
            the design came out looking very unique. We thought it looked pretty
            cool but they still looked like two separate designs and not that
            cohesive. This is when we decided to experiment more with the color
            schemes as well as drawing styles to make it appear more as one
            final piece.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding
            process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This
            might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or
            using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating
            and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly
            groundbreaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            To first make the color schemes match, we passed in the color
            palette used from Rebecca’s design into Mansi’s design so that the
            colors match. We then randomized each of the line colors by picking
            a random one from the given array color palette as illustrated
            below. Sometimes, this would lead to every line having the same
            color but we thought it would be cool that sometimes the lines are
            monochrome while other times, they have different shades involved.
          </p>
          <break></break>
          <p>
            We then experimented with the initial particle structure, changing
            how the noise texture appeared on the screen. We played around with
            the transparency levels to overlay varying opacity levels of colors
            to indicate depth on the design itself. We also expanded the lower
            and upper bound for the particle radius, giving way to a smoother
            feel from the generative art. In addition, we first attempted to
            increase the maximum number of particles to see what would happen,
            around 500 as the maximum, but quickly realized that the browser was
            unable to render that many at once. As a result, after switching the
            values down to around 150, we noticed that the browser was not only
            able to generate the particles faster, but the particle trail was
            more visible within the art piece itself. In addition, then we tried
            integrating another variation, but changing the initial direction
            and evolution fo the particles. After experimenting with a variety
            of fixed combinations for the initial lower bound range of width and
            height, setting them equal created a unique spiral movement and
            pattern when generated. Below are a couple of visual examples from
            the experimentation elements explained here.
          </p>
          <break></break>
          <p>
            Finally, we modified the fourth variation of noise particle clusters
            even further to change the styling compared to the other cluster
            variations. First, we attempted to supersize the radius of the
            cluster particle variation to 130, which looked absolutely
            incredible. Because of its sheer size, the particles floated like
            bubbles across the screen compared to the thinner ones snaking
            across the screen. However, as much as we liked this design
            variation, we realized that our computers could barely keep up with
            the amount of particles generated on the screen. As a result, we
            switched to another option of having an increased radius cluster,
            but reducing the size to allow for easier particle generation with
            the computers. We are super excited with how the end result looks
            with each variation completely unique from the rest. Below are
            images of the experimentation we described here.

            <li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
            <p>
              Mansi - I started by imitating the Perlin noise effects with the
              branches created and ran into a few bugs on how the noise
              particles were being generated. After debugging and fixing this
              region, I attempted to integrate a given color dataset into the
              design to randomize the generated art output. I later transitioned
              to Rebecca’s implementation of the imported color array library
              instead of the innovation step. In addition, I experimented with
              the particle structure and generation in the innovation step to
              create a smooth design that flowed with the slow-moving noise
              particles. I also experimented with particle movement to generate
              varying sizes, shapes, and angles of particles to generate unique
              flowing generative art. In addition, I also created a modified
              variation of the particle design to change the particle cluster
              generation direction and design. I also documented our work from
              the imitation and innovation stages of the project and explained
              how we experimented in each section.
            </p>
            <li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
            <p>
              We are extremely happy with the end result of the generative noise
              design, especially with how each iteration is completely unique
              from the previous one. Initially, we were a bit hesitant on how
              two designs would be merged together, but we quickly realized that
              our concepts would flow perfectly together. After both Mansi and
              Rebecca’s designs were merged together, we realized that we could
              make the design appear as though the noise was emerging from the
              shape art background. As a result, after experimenting with the
              noise particle generation and movement, the ending art result was
              unexpected, yet beautiful. We worked well together as a team to
              split up the work and merge the results together. With pair
              programming and varying schedules, we were unsure how the
              collaboration would ultimately turn out, but with both of our
              unique ideas, the end result looks seamlessly combined and
              visually pleasing to the eye.
            </p>
            <li>Brief highs and lows</li>
            <p>
              One major high of this project was how the art piece final result
              turned out with the randomized colors and trailed noise particle
              generation. We were shocked with how we were able to combine two
              completely different designs together to create a cohesive art
              style and noise-inspired masterpiece as a whole. In addition, we
              are also happy on how the random color generation helped create
              depth to the art piece, where the background colors were more
              muted and the foreground colors were brighter and popping. In
              addition, we were surprised with how our piece almost had a 3-D
              effect with how the noise particles moved together in clusters.
              Some lows of the project were the debugging during the imitation
              and integration stages of the project. Despite the fix for the
              Perlin noise simulation being relatively simple, trying to figure
              out the bug of particle positioning and naming conventions took a
              while to figure out. In addition, during the integration portion
              of the project, we struggled to understand how to merge both art
              designs together, since the coding structure itself was completely
              different. After converting the design to include a given class,
              the rest of the design unfolded on itself quite nicely.

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>
					For innovate, we tried using a different dataset to draw out our piece. We pulled a greenhouse gas 
					emissions file and decided to use that. Since this dataset wasn't as number heavy, we had to think 
					about how we wanted to use the data to plot each circle. The dataset was also huge compared to our 
					previous one, so we decided to remove a few rows to make it appear less crowded on the screen. We also 
					experimented around with the color scheme and how we should assign colors to each element. After, we 
					also messed around with how the circles look by changing how the edges are drawn. Through experimentation, 
					we came up with our final piece which we really liked.

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Rebecca - I mainly worked on the innovate step as well as this reflection. I worked on implementing 
					the new data set into our piece as well as edited how the circles are plotted based on the data provided. 
					I also made the colors correspond to each type of data in the data set. I was also responsible for 
					adjusting any aesthetics and experimenting with how the circles look.
				</p>

					This assignment was rather difficult for us. We had trouble originally working with a database system 
					to retrieve the data in order to plot our circles. We tried multiple methods but a lot of them werenâ€™t 
					working properly for us. We then finally got it working through Vercel which we were very proud of. 
					Besides the databse/networking part, we really enjoyed this assignment. It made us really think about 
					how we can turn data into art. When we think about data representation, we usually imagine graphs and 
					bar charts, but never as artwork. It was fun to try and represent the data into interesting objects/shapes 
					and play around with how it lays out on the screen. This makes data seem more interesting and fun to 
					look at. We are really proud of the outcome and how nice it turned out. We are also proud of how we 
					were able to work with the datasets/databse systems as this was our first time using it with p5js.
				</p>
				<p>
					One high would be getting the dataset loaded in properly and being able to plot it as colorful circles. 
					We were really proud when we were able to figure out how to use the csv file and convert those data points 
					into an interesting piece of art. One low would be trying to implement the database. As you can see, we had 
					multiple attempts trying to get the database working. This was completely new to us so it was hard to figure 
					out how it should work but once we did, we were really proud of it.

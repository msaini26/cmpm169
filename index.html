          <p>
            Hello world! My name is Mansi, and I am a computer science: computer
            game design student at UC Santa Cruz. I am passionate about
            human-computer interaction, specifically inclusive and accessible
            design. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, kayaking, and
            learning new languages. Enjoy a picture from one of my favorite
            hikes!

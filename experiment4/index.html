        <h1>Experiment 4 - Subject/Topic</h1>
        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            We decided to imitate this
            <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/909153">example</a>. For
            this example, we learned how to set up the camera and utilize it as
            an element of our piece. For the initial setup, the camera settings
            were relatively straightforward to follow as long as camera
            permissions were open within the web browser. When the first art
            mode was created, we displayed the camera video feed changing with
            the Mandarin characters. In the camera feed image, we put a bright
            phone screen in a dimly lit room, and the shape of the phone and its
            excess brightness emittance are shown in the letters themselves. One
            area we are interested in exploring is the lettering output and what
            might happen if we change how the art output is created from the
            video feed itself. In another art mode, the shapes were distored and
            blue with the phone brightness while the rest of the squares were
            red.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            For integration, we wanted to experiment around with overlaying some
            effects on top of our current example. We found this
            <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1613173">example</a>
            of making images captured from a video constantly spin in circles
            with the mouse as its origin. When trying to implement it, we ran
            into some issues with detecting which button is pressed as well as
            adding filters to the video. We decided to make the spinning video
            appear in the center of the screen when the spacebar is pressed
            down, instead of following the mouse and showing up on mouse click.
            After we got that working, we started to play around with some
            effects.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            Our intial thought was that showing a plain video of what is being
            captured is relatively boring. To make it more interesting, we
            decided to add a filter to the spinning video. We ran into some
            issues again where the filters were being applied to everything on
            the canvas, but we eventually figured out how to specify it so that
            the filter is only being applied to the spinning video.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Mansi - I worked on the imitation stage, tying the camera effects
            learned from lecture and an example with Mandarin characters
            representing the video feed itself. I incorporated multiple art
            modes to provide an element of interactivity in the art piece, which
            is something we wanted to explore during the integration phase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rebecca - I mainly worked on the integration step as well as part of
            the innovation process. I found the example of the spinning video
            and implemented it into our experiment. There were a few issues that
            came along the way but I helped figure it out. I also applied some
            filters to the video to try and make our piece look more interesting
            and unique. We both helped write up this document/reflection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, this experiment turned out looking pretty cool. It was both
            of our first times using the camera to help create a piece of
            artwork so it took us some time to fully understand how it works.
            Once we got it working, things quickly started getting more
            interesting and we were able to expand vastly from our original
            example. We had a lot of fun playing around with the different
            video/image capabilities and also tested out what we liked/disliked.
          </p>

            One highlight of this experiment was how seamless the imitation
            process was, especially considering the technicalities of camera
            integration. From the professorâ€™s demonstrations in the lecture, the
            Mandarin character example seemed quite difficult to create,
            especially considering the video feed connection with pixelated
            letters and shapes. In the end, setting up the camera and video feed
            to pixels was quite simpler than we imagined, which allowed us to
            experiment more during the integration and innovation phases of the
            project. Also, one low of this experiment was that we both lost
            power and connection during our work session times for the project.
            As a result, we had to utilize as much time as we could whenever the
            power would come back on during the storm. We generally have a set
            timeline of when we want to work on each part of the experiment, but
            our timeline was changed slightly because of the storm this past
            weekend. Besides that, we also really enjoyed experimenting around
            with the different camera effects. Although there were some issues
            during the process, once we figured it out, it all turned out
            looking pretty cool.
